Purpose:
I originally created this program for a final when I was in college. The goal of the final was to 
modify a program you made at home in class in a very noticable way. I chose tictactoe because I 
thought it would be fun.

Goal:
To create a functioning game of tictactoe that would be open for customization.

How this was achieved:
I used a matrix to hold all positions in a standard 3x3 grid formation. I numbered all
the grid spots and prompted an input from the player. This input would allow for the
selection of a spot on the matrix. When there are matrixes that align three in a row, 
that respective player wins.

The game:
The X goes to the first player and the O goes to the second player. When prompted the 
player will select a spot and then the next player will select a spot. This continues 
until there is three in a row or it is impossible to get three in a row.
